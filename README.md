# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Problem Statement

The task is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a person has diabetes or not. This binary classification model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of diabetes, enabling early interventions and personalized treatment.

## Objective

The objective of the project is to create a reliable binary classification model that can classify individuals into two groups: "Diabetic" and "Non-Diabetic". By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to provide an effective tool for diabetes risk assessment and management.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains information about female Pima Indians aged 21 years and older. This dataset is commonly employed for binary classification tasks to predict diabetes occurrence.

Dataset Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## Methodology

The methodology for the Diabetes Prediction involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, specifically the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical and visualization techniques are employed to explore the dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and potential correlations.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Null values are replaced with median values, and outliers are removed to ensure data quality.

4. **Feature Selection and Engineering:** Relevant features are selected for the model, and new features are created if necessary to enhance predictive performance.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, KNeighbours Classifier, and MLP Classifier are trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## Results

The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of each model are compared to determine the best-performing algorithm for diabetes prediction.

## Conclusion

The developed machine learning model provides a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk of diabetes. Further refinements and enhancements can be made to improve the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
